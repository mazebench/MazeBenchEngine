# MazeBench

MazeBench is a long-horizon maze-navigation environment for reinforcement learning and evaluation with [Prime Intellect Verifiers](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers).

Models navigate a real JavaScript maze world one action at a time, preserve state across rooms, collect gems, discover new rooms, and push blocks. Every rollout produces deterministic rewards, metrics, and replay data from the same game engine used by the local MazeBench site.

> **Environment:** `mazebench/mazebench`
> **Native API:** Verifiers v1 `Taskset` + `Harness`
> **Hosted compatibility:** Classic `MultiTurnEnv` adapter for Prime CLI 0.6.x
> **Default observation:** ASCII
> **Visibility:** Private

The package brings its own Node runtime for the JavaScript maze engine. Perspective vision additionally needs `playwright-core` and a compatible Chromium binary, which Prime's current Hosted Training image does not provide. Until that renderer is self-contained and tested, use ASCII mode for Hosted Training. Prime-hosted agentic runs use the evaluator-owned renderer instead: Bash, Claude Code, Codex, Kimi Code, Null, and Pi receive each frame as an MCP image result. RLM and the isolated CLI-gateway harnesses remain text-only.

## The task

The model receives the current observation and must answer with exactly one command. MazeBench applies that command to a persistent game session and returns the next observation.

The default objective is to collect **100 unique gems** across the world. A rollout wins only when `game_won_gem_count` is reached; collecting one gem does not mark the world complete.

### Commands

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` | Move one screen-relative step. |
| `rotate camera up`, `rotate camera down`, `rotate camera left`, `rotate camera right` | Change the camera pitch or yaw. |
| `undo` | Undo the most recent movement. Collected-gem progress remains monotonic. |
| `reset` | Reset the current room to its entry state. Global score remains monotonic. |
| `go to level X Y` | Return to a previously visited room. |
| `quit` | End the rollout as a loss when quitting is enabled. |

Movement remains screen-relative after camera rotation. `go to level` is restricted to rooms already present in `visited_levels`.

Every model-facing observation uses the same metadata contract: observation mode, current room and view, yaw, total gem count, the complete list of visited rooms, and terminal state. ASCII adds `level`, JSON adds `json_observation`, and vision adds an MCP PNG image. A blocked movement is never reported explicitly. If the player dies, the observation does report `player_dead`, a death message, and the only valid recovery commands. Board-state hashes, movement flags, push counters, and exact collected-gem IDs remain evaluator-only.

## Rewards

MazeBench exposes three independent deterministic reward signals:

| Reward | Default weight | Definition |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `gem_score` | `1.0` | Unique gems collected. When `target_gems > 0`, this component is normalized to that target. |
| `room_exploration_score` | `0.1` | Newly visited rooms after the starting room. |
| `block_progress_score` | `0.05` | Novel block positions reached by pushing. Repeating the same positions does not farm reward. |

These are final rollout scores calculated from authoritative game state. Reward weights shape learning without changing the semantic win condition.

Evaluator-only metrics saved after the rollout include:

- `collected_gems`
- `visited_level_count`
- `current_level_solved`
- `block_pushes`
- `novel_block_positions`

## Install

Install the latest private Hub version while authenticated as an authorized Prime account:

```bash
prime env install mazebench/mazebench
```

Install a specific version for reproducibility:

```bash
prime env install mazebench/mazebench@0.1.14
```

## Evaluate locally

MazeBench uses the Verifiers v1 evaluator:

```bash
uv run eval mazebench \
  -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini \
  -n 1 \
  -r 1 \
  --max-turns 40 \
  --taskset.max-actions 40 \
  --rich false
```

Use the Hub identifier directly when the environment is not already installed under its local name:

```bash
uv run eval mazebench/mazebench \
  -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini \
  -n 1 \
  -r 1 \
  --max-turns 40 \
  --rich false
```

The saved `results.jsonl` trace contains:

- `info.maze_actions` — normalized action records and per-action game status
- `info.maze_auto_quit` — novelty counts and percentage when auto-quit fires
- `info.maze_scorecard` — the final authoritative scorecard
- `info.maze_replay` — initial state, accepted actions, and final scorecard
- `rewards` — all three reward components
- `metrics` — gems, rooms, room state, and block progress

These scoring fields are evaluator output for the run owner. The model never
receives the scorecard. ASCII and vision observations omit explicit player
coordinates and elevation; JSON observations retain coordinates by design.

## Hosted Training

Choose an available model with:

```bash
prime train models
```

Minimal Hosted Training configuration:

```toml
name = "MazeBench"
model = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B"
max_steps = 100
batch_size = 512
rollouts_per_example = 16

[sampling]
max_tokens = 1024
temperature = 1.0

[[env]]
id = "mazebench/mazebench"

[env.args]
num_train_examples = 1
num_eval_examples = 1
observation_mode = "ascii"
start_level_id = "level_HxI"
max_actions = 256
game_won_gem_count = 100
gem_reward_weight = 1.0
room_reward_weight = 0.1
push_reward_weight = 0.05
allow_quit = false
auto_quit = true
auto_quit_threshold = 10.0
auto_quit_mode = "rolling"
auto_quit_window = 100
```

Launch it from a CPU machine; Prime hosts the training infrastructure:

```bash
prime train configs/rl/mazebench.toml
```

For long-horizon maze rollouts, keep `batch_size` divisible by `rollouts_per_example`. Start conservatively and inspect early reward distributions before increasing the run size.

### Monitor a training run

```bash
# Overall lifecycle status
prime train get <run-id>

# Orchestrator and environment-server health
prime train components <run-id>

# Latest completed training step
prime train progress <run-id>

# Reward and optimization metrics
prime train metrics <run-id>

# Live orchestrator logs
prime train logs <run-id> -f

# Environment-server logs
prime train logs <run-id> --env mazebench/0 -f

# Tokens and estimated cost
prime train usage <run-id>
```

A run is truly producing training work when `progress.latest_step` is non-null, metrics contain records, and token usage begins increasing. A `RUNNING` lifecycle status with zero tokens can still mean the infrastructure is starting or the environment is loading.

## Configuration reference

Prime CLI 0.6.x passes these settings under `[env.args]` to MazeBench's hosted compatibility adapter. The package also exports the same settings through its native v1 `MazeBenchConfig` for local v1 evaluation and future hosted taskset support.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `num_examples` | integer | `1` | Number of generated tasks. |
| `start_level_id` | string | `level_HxI` | Starting room used when `level_ids` is unset. |
| `level_ids` | string or list | `None` | Optional starting-room set. Accepts `HxI` or `level_HxI`. |
| `view` | string | `top-diagonal` | Initial ASCII camera view. |
| `yaw` | integer | `0` | Initial camera yaw. |
| `game_won_gem_count` | integer | `100` | Unique gems required for a semantic win. |
| `gem_reward_weight` | number | `1.0` | Gem reward multiplier. |
| `room_reward_weight` | number | `0.1` | New-room reward multiplier. |
| `push_reward_weight` | number | `0.05` | Novel-block-position reward multiplier. |
| `max_actions` | integer or `None` | `256` | Maximum accepted MazeBench actions. `None` removes the action ceiling in v1 evaluations. |
| `unlimited` | boolean | `false` | Hosted-compatibility switch that removes the action ceiling. |
| `allow_quit` | boolean | `true` | Whether `quit` may end the rollout. |
| `auto_quit` | boolean | `false` | Stop the rollout when its percentage of globally novel board states reaches the configured threshold. |
| `auto_quit_threshold` | number | `10.0` | New-state percentage at or below which auto-quit fires. |
| `auto_quit_mode` | `cumulative` or `rolling` | `rolling` | Measure novelty across the whole rollout or a rolling action window. |
| `auto_quit_window` | integer | `100` | Rolling-mode action window. Rolling mode waits until this window is full. |
| `target_gems` | integer | `0` | Optional gem-score normalization target. `0` uses raw gem count. |
| `observation_mode` | `ascii`, `json`, or `vision` | `ascii` | Observation surface. Hosted Training supports `ascii` and `json`. |
| `omniscient` | boolean | `false` | JSON mode includes every object in the current room instead of only ASCII-visible objects. |
| `hide_names` | boolean | `false` | JSON mode replaces object names except `player` and `gem` with stable per-rollout letter IDs. |
| `repo_root` | string or null | `None` | Optional MazeBench runtime override. |
| `node_bin` | string | `node` | Node executable used by the JS bridge. |
| `timeout_seconds` | integer | `20` | Timeout for JS observation and scoring calls. |
| `vision_width` | integer | `512` | Experimental local vision-frame width. |
| `vision_height` | integer | `512` | Experimental local vision-frame height. |
| `vision_view` | string | `1` | Experimental vision radius: `1`–`26` rings or `world`. |
| `system_prompt` | string | packaged prompt | Optional instruction override. |

Player lifts are state-labeled in model observations: ASCII uses `>` on top
when lowered, `L` on top when raised, and `l` on lift sides; JSON uses
`player_lift_lowered`/`player_lift_raised`. Orange walls use `O` on top and `o`
on the sides (`o` is not a lowered state). Orange buttons are top-only surface
attachments rendered as `8`, with no side character. Pressing a button moves
each `orange_wall` down one elevation, reflected in its JSON coordinate.

Framework controls such as `max_turns`, token limits, sampling, batch size, and rollout count belong outside the taskset configuration.

The Agent Runner's **Unlimited** Prime option uses both layers: it sets the
MazeBench action ceiling to `None` and Verifiers' framework `max_turns` to
`None`. The rollout then ends only when the game ends, Auto-Quit fires, the
user stops it, an inference/runtime error occurs, or an external hosted runtime
timeout is reached.

Auto-quit uses the authoritative `board_state_hash` returned by the game
engine. A state is novel only on its first appearance in the entire rollout.
Cumulative mode includes the initial observation; rolling mode evaluates
action observations and waits for a full window. Warning countdowns are
conditional: they assume subsequent actions keep revisiting already observed
states. Reaching a new state raises the novelty rate and can move the cutoff
farther away.

## Experimental local vision

Vision mode uses the same persistent game state, commands, stop conditions, rewards, and metrics as ASCII mode. Instead of an ASCII board, the model receives a short non-positional status message and a perspective PNG frame.

It currently requires a full MazeBench checkout with Node dependencies plus a compatible Chrome or Chromium binary:

```bash
npm install

uv run --project environments/mazebench eval mazebench \
  -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini \
  -n 1 \
  -r 1 \
  --max-turns 8 \
  --taskset.observation-mode vision \
  --taskset.vision-width 512 \
  --taskset.vision-height 512 \
  --rich false
```

Do not select vision for Hosted Training until the environment publishes a self-contained renderer runtime and the Hub action includes a real frame-render smoke test.

## Local agent tooling

The repository also contains a `mazebench_codex` plugin and a much broader local Agent runner supporting Codex, Claude Code, Docker access, tools, orchestration, live views, pause/resume, and replay controls. Those capabilities are separate from the `mazebench/mazebench` Hosted Training environment.

The local `/agent` page discovers every built-in shipped by the exact pinned
Verifiers package. Native MCP harnesses use the external `mazebench-tools`
server, Codex receives generated MCP configuration, and non-MCP command
harnesses receive an equivalent capability-scoped CLI. The task sent through
the harness channel contains no repository or checkpoint path, the live trace
state is an empty strict schema, and final scoring replaces it with an
evaluator-owned snapshot after the harness exits. New built-ins follow the
native-MCP or generic CLI route automatically when the scheduled exact-pin
update passes certification.

In these coding-agent paths, scoring is finalized after the agent exits. The
agent-facing helper exposes start, observe, and action operations, but no
scorecard operation.

The local Codex v1 harness can be exercised from a full checkout with:

```bash
uv run --project environments/mazebench eval mazebench_codex \
  --harness.id mazebench_codex_harness \
  --harness.runtime.type prime \
  --harness.runtime.image node:24-bookworm-slim \
  -m openai/gpt-5 \
  -n 1 \
  -r 1 \
  --taskset.max-actions 100 \
  --max-turns 40 \
  --rich false
```

## Runtime and reproducibility

The wheel bundles the JavaScript maze bridge, game engine, world map, levels, renderer source, images, and 3D assets. ASCII evaluation does not require a user-managed background server.

The Verifiers dependency is pinned to the revision used for validation. Prime Hosted Training 0.6.x currently resolves Hub environments through the classic `load_environment` contract, so MazeBench publishes a `MultiTurnEnv` adapter alongside its native v1 taskset. Both paths share the same JavaScript game engine, commands, reward definitions, metrics, and win condition.

Pin a specific MazeBench Hub version in important experiments, record the complete training config, and launch a new run when changing environment versions; publishing an update does not mutate an already-running training job.
